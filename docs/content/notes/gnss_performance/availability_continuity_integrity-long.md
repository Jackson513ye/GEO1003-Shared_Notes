## Availability, Continuity and Integrity

- Availability: the percentage of time that a sufficient amount of satellites have unblocked direct lines of sight (LOSs).
- Continuity: the ability of the total navigation system to continue to perform its function during the intended operation. Continuity is critical whenever reliance on a particular system is high. For a pilot during an instrument approach procedure, continuity and integrity are vital.
- Integrity: how much the information supplied by the system can be trusted to be correct. This requires the system to provide timely warnings to the user when the equipment is unreliable for navigation purposes—due to obstructions, jamming, multipath, or any other event that degrades accuracy.
