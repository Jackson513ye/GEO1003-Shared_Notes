## Selected Portions from the Handbook on European data protection law: 2018 Edition

### Data Processing Terminology

#### Personal Data
Under EU law, personal data is defined as all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Either the identity of the person is manifestly clear, or it can be inferred from additional information. If there is even a slight possibility that information can be used to identify a person, that information is personal data.

A person who's data is being processed is a 'data subject'.

Information that can be used to identify a person includes:
- Name
- Identification number
- Location data
- Online identifier
- Vehicle registration number
- Physical characteristics
- Genetic data
- Cultural identity

When considering if information can be used to identify the natural person it concerns, the time needed and cost required are taken into account.

The form that personal data takes is not relevant to the laws that govern its usage. CCTV footage, recorded audio, pictures, DNA samples and digital communications are all examples of personal data.

#### Anonymisation
Data cannot be kept in a form that allows for identification longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is being processed. After personal data has served its purpose it needs to either be erased or anonymised. Data is anonymised when all identifying elements are removed.

Data that has been anonymised properly is no longer considered personal data and therefor data protection legislation no longer applies.

#### Pseudonymisation
Personal data that has undergone pseudonymisation has had identifying elements replaced by a pseudonym. The additional information that could lead to identification of a data subject is kept separately.

#### Data Processing
Data processing covers a large number of possible actions. Examples include:
- collection
- organisation
- structuring
- storage
- alteration
- retrieval
- usage
- disclosure
- restriction
- erasure

Automated and non-automated processes both count as data processing.

#### Users of Personal Data
There are two types of entities that handle personal data: controllers and processors. A controller is a natural or legal person that determines the purpose and means of processing. A processor is a natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the controller. A controller oversees and controls the processing, as well as being responsible and legally liable.

### Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency of Processing Principles

#### Lawfulness of Processing
Lawful processing of personal data requires the consent of the data subject or another legimate reason. The other five reasons are:
1. When processing personal data is necessary for performance of a contract.
2. For the performance of a task by a public authority.
3. For compliance with a legal obligation.
4. For the purpose of the legitimate interests of the controller or third parties.
5. Or if necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject.

##### Consent
Controllers have a duty to keep a verifiable record of any consent received. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. The four characteristics of consent are:
1. Free: Consent must be freely given.
2. Informed: The data subject must have sufficient information before making a decision.
3. Specific: For consent to be valid it must also be specific to the processing purpose.
4. Unambiguous: There should be no reasonable doubt that the data subject wanted to express their agreement to the processing of their data.

#### Fairness of Processing
Data subjects should be notified by controllers that they are processing their data in a lawful and transparent matter, and should be able to demonstrate that they are doing so.

#### Transparency of Processing
Controllers are obligated to take appropriate measures to ensure that data subjects remain informed about how their data is being used.

### Data Processing Principles

#### The Principle of Purpose Limitation
Data cannot be processed further in way that is not compatible with the original purpose, although exceptions are possible if the new purpose is either:
- Archiving purposes in the public interest.
- Scientific or historical research.
- Statistical purposes.

#### The Data Minimisation Principle
Processing of personal data must be limited to what is necessary to fulfil a legitimate purpose.

#### The Data Accuracy Principle
A controller holding personal data is not allowed to process said data without ensuring with reasonable certainty that the data are correct and up to date.

#### The Storage Limitation Principle
Data must be deleted or anonymised as soon as they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected.

#### The Data Security Principle
Controllers of personal data are required to implement appropriate technical or organisational measures when processing data. How appropriate a security measure is depends on the context and is determined on a case-by-case basis and should be regularly reviewed.

#### The Accountability Principle
Controllers and processors are required to actively and continuously implement measures to promote and safeguard data protection in their processing activities.
