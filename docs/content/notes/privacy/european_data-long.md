## Selected Portions from the Handbook on European data protection law: 2018 Edition

### Data Processing Terminology

#### Personal Data
Under EU law, personal data is defined as all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Either the identity of the person is manifestly clear, or it can be inferred from additional information. If there is even a slight possibility that information can be used to identify a person, that information is personal data.

A person who's data is being processed is a 'data subject'.

If information relates to an identified or identifiable person it is personal data. This includes opinions of a person by someone else, for example the results of a workplace assessment.

Information that can be used to identify a person includes:
- Name
- Identification number
- Location data
- Online identifier
- Vehicle registration number
- Physical characteristics
- Genetic data
- Cultural identity

Name, date of birth and place of birth are rarely enough to identify a single person, but if used in conjunction with each other they can single someone out.

When considering if information can be used to identify the natural person it concerns, the time needed and cost required are taken into account. Technology available during the time of processing as well as technological developments are also considered.

The form that personal data takes is not relevant to the laws that govern its usage. CCTV footage, recorded audio, pictures, DNA samples and digital communications are all examples of personal data.

#### Anonymisation
Data cannot be kept in a form that allows for identification longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is being processed. After personal data has served its purpose it needs to either be erased or anonymised.

Data is anonymised when all identifying elements are removed. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for anonymisation. The optimal solution needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Data is anonymised if no parts of that data can, with reasonable effort, lead to the identification of a natural person. What constitutes reasonable effort depends on the nature of the anonymised data, the context of their use, the available technologies and related costs.

Data that has been anonymised properly is no longer considered personal data and therefor data protection legislation no longer applies.

#### Pseudonymisation
Personal data that has undergone pseudonymisation has had identifying elements replaced by a pseudonym. The additional information that could lead to identification of a data subject is kept separately. Encrypted data is an example of pseudonymized data, as an additional encryption key is required to make sense of the information. Unlike anonymized data, pseudonymized data is still considered personal data under EU law.

#### Data Processing
Data processing covers a large number of possible actions. Examples include:
- collection
- organisation
- structuring
- storage
- alteration
- retrieval
- usage
- disclosure
- restriction
- erasure

Automated and non-automated processes both count as data processing.

#### Users of Personal Data
There are two types of entities that handle personal data: controllers and processors. A controller is a natural or legal person that determines the purpose and means of processing. A processor is a natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the controller. A controller oversees and controls the processing, as well as being responsible and legally liable.

A processor becomes a controller if they determine the means and purposes of data processing themselves.

Any person to whom personal data are disclosed is a 'recipient'.

### Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency of Processing Principles

#### Lawfulness of Processing
Lawful processing of personal data requires the consent of the data subject or another legimate reason. The other five reasons are:
1. When processing personal data is necessary for performance of a contract.
2. For the performance of a task by a public authority.
3. For compliance with a legal obligation.
4. For the purpose of the legitimate interests of the controller or third parties.
5. Or if necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject.

##### Consent
Controllers have a duty to keep a verifiable record of any consent received. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. The four characteristics of consent are:
1. Free: Consent must be freely given. Consent is only valid if the data subject was given a real choice with no risk of intimidation, deception or coercion.
2. Informed: The data subject must have sufficient information before making a decision. The purposes for which the personal data is necessary should be precise and easily understandable.
3. Specific: For consent to be valid it must also be specific to the processing purpose. If the processing is changed or expanded the data subject must give consent again.
4. Unambiguous: There should be no reasonable doubt that the data subject wanted to express their agreement to the processing of their data.

#### Fairness of Processing
Data subjects should be notified by controllers that they are processing their data in a lawful and transparent matter, and should be able to demonstrate that they are doing so. Processing should not happen in secret and data subjects should be aware of any potential risks.

#### Transparency of Processing
Controllers are obligated to take appropriate measures to ensure that data subjects remain informed about how their data is being used. Transparency can mean:
- The information given to a data subject before processing.
- The information that should be available to the subject during processing.
- The information given when a data subject requests to access their own data.

Processing operation must be explained to the data subject and a way that is easily accessible.

### Data Processing Principles

#### The Principle of Purpose Limitation
Data subjects must know what the processing of their personal data will entail before processing is started. Data cannot be processed further in way that is not compatible with the original purpose, although exceptions are possible if the new purpose is either:
- Archiving purposes in the public interest.
- Scientific or historical research.
- Statistical purposes.
Every new purpose for processing data which is not compatible with the original one must have its own particular legal basis.

#### The Data Minimisation Principle
Processing of personal data must be limited to what is necessary to fulfil a legitimate purpose. The processing of personal data should only take place if the purpose of processing said data cannot be achieved through other means. Data processing is not allowed to disproportionately interfere with the interests, rights and freedoms at stake.

#### The Data Accuracy Principle
A controller holding personal data is not allowed to process said data without ensuring with reasonable certainty that the data are correct and up to date. Inaccurate data must be erased or rectified without delay. It is possible that data may need to be checked regularly so as to ensure its accuracy. In some cases it may be legally prohibited to update stored data, as the purpose of storing the data is to provide a historical 'snap-shot'.

#### The Storage Limitation Principle
Data must be deleted or anonymised as soon as they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected. The controller of the data should establish a time limit for erasure or periodic review.

#### The Data Security Principle
Controllers of personal data are required to implement appropriate technical or organisational measures when processing data. How appropriate a security measure is depends on the context and is determined on a case-by-case basis and should be regularly reviewed. Pseudoanonymizing data is a way in which to secure personal data. Another example of a security measure is if controllers offer the option of two-factor authentication, is this will make it more difficult for unlawful access of personal data. Data controllers are required to communicate with supervisory authorities if a breach of personal data occurs. If the breach is likely to result in a risk to a data subjects rights or freedoms, they should also be informed.

#### The Accountability Principle
Controllers and processors are required to actively and continuously implement measures to promote and safeguard data protection in their processing activities. Controllers must be able to prove compliance with data protection laws at any time. Processors also have obligations, such as keeping a record of processing operations.
