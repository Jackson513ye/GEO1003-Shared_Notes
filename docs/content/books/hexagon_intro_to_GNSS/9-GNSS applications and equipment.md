## 9 - GNSS applications and equipment

> pages 83-98 of Hexagon intro to GNSS

GNSS technologies have revolutionized the way businesses and governments operate, this chapter highlight _some_ of the ways they have.

### 9.1 - Consumer

GNSS receivers are now common in consumer hardware like phones, mostly for routing (like Goole Maps).

### 9.2 - Transportation

In rail transportation GNSS is used to keep track of all trains and monitor them form a control room.
In aviation GNSS is used for routing and to make sure planes don't collide midair.
These same patterns of monitoring and routing hold for shipping, driving, biking etc.

Other uses include (semi)autonomous driving or parking.
A special case mentioned is that of snowplows using PPP positioning to plow roads covered in so much snow the driver can't even see where they are.

### 9.3 - Machine control

GNSS technology is being integrated into equipment such as bulldozers, excavators, graders, pavers and farm machinery to enhance productivity in the real-time operation of this equipment, and to provide situational awareness information to the equipment operator.

The book lists these benefits:

- EFFICIENCY:
By helping the equipment operator get to the desired grade more quickly, GNSS helps speed up the work, reducing capital and operating costs.
- ACCURACY:
The precision achievable by GNSS-based solutions minimises the need to stop work while a survey crew measures the grade.
- JOB MANAGEMENT:
Managers and contractors have access to accurate information about the job site, and the information can be viewed remotely.
- DATA MANAGEMENT:
Users can print out status reports, save important data and transfer files to head office.
- THEFT DETECTION:
GNSS allows users to define a “virtual fence” around their equipment and property for the purpose of automatically raising an alarm when equipment is removed, then providing equipment tracking information to the authorities.

GNSS technologies are now very common on farming equipment because these precise systems require less labour and run 24/7.
GNSS technologies are also common in construction and surface mining for the same reasons.

### 9.4 - Survey

GNSS surveying is much quicker than traditional surveying. Using GNSS, it is possible for a single surveyor to accomplish in one day what might have taken a survey crew of three people a week to complete

### 9.5 - Aerial photogrammetry

Using GNSS and INS, areal photos can be located and used for applications like Google Earth or mapping wildfires.

### 9.6 - Ground mapping

Infrastructure visualisation: using a LiDAR device combined with GNSS+INS, a user can capture comprehensive visual information of key infrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines.

### 9.7 - Timing

As we mentioned in earlier chapters, time accuracy is critical for GNSS position determination.
This is why GNSS satellites are equipped with atomic clocks that are accurate to nanoseconds.
As part of the position determining process, the local time of GNSS receivers becomes synchronised with the very accurate satellite time.

### 9.8 - Defence

The defence sector makes broad use of GNSS technology, including:

- NAVIGATION:
Using GNSS receivers, soldiers and pilots can navigate unfamiliar terrain or conduct night-time operations.
Most foot soldiers now carry hand-held GNSS receivers.
- SEARCH AND RESCUE:
If a plane crashes and has a search and rescue beacon equipped with a GNSS receiver, it can be located more quickly.
- RECONNAISSANCE AND MAP CREATION:
The military uses GNSS to create maps of uncharted or enemy territory. They can also mark reconnaissance points using GNSS.
- UNMANNED VEHICLES:
Unmanned vehicles are used extensively in military applications, including reconnaissance, logistics, target and decoy, mine detection, search and rescue, research and development and missions in unsecured or contaminated areas.
- MUNITIONS GUIDANCE:
Precision munitions use GNSS to ensure they land on target.
